<h3>What is the Ball Point Game?</h3> 

The Ball Point Game is a real life group exercise to explore the basics of Agility. <br />
Players experience the concepts of iterative work, retrospectives and self-organization with the help of
a fun ball game.

<h3>What is the Remote Ball Point Game?</h3> 

Like the name suggests, the remote ball point game provides the possibility to play the game online
with distributed teams. <br />

The game itself simply provides the setup as often given in trainings: a meeting room, balls, a timer
and flipcharts with some explanations.
Like in a real life scenario a trainer should facilitate and debrief the game to connect the experiences
of the players with the theory about Agility.
